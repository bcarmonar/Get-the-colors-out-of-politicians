# Title of the project

Final project of the course Building AI

## Summary

Politicians often lie when giving figures and data. With this tool we intend to compare one and the other with the real ones, as a lie detector. A small screen will be installed in front of the microphone that will turn red every time it is untrue.

## Background

With these instructions that we believe we are going to solve the veracity that the Spanish political class suffers from, in my case, since I am Spanish. There are innumerable cases that occur in which the inconsistencies in what they said a long time ago, and what they say now, are refuted. They do not follow guidelines and discipline when it comes to speaking, where they used to say “digo”, now they say “diego”. This is a very common Spanish expression that reflects that they change the speech according to their convenience. There are cases of real impudence when making statements or interviews, in which they literally deceive the population.

We will try to give veracity to:
• Interviews
• Statements
• Manifests
• Discussions
• Concentrations
• Assemblies


## How is it used?

A solution to this endemic problem, already rooted in the political class, not only in Spain, but internationally, is necessary. Lying for the sake of lying, especially some, carry it in their genes, and they do it so naturally that a large part of the population follows and applauds them. Their voices do not tremble when a political opponent rebuts them, because they follow their own, the lie. It is important that ordinary people know what kind of rulers they have, who they trust and who to entrust their votes to when going to the polls, because they will be the ones who will defend their interests.

## Data sources and AI methods
The data comes from the network, from the media, which are the ones that have all the files, both written and audio. Press, radio, television, RRSS, etc. They will be direct witnesses and judges of everything that comes out of their mouths and will immediately be the target of the magnifying glass when passing through their respective newspaper archives.

## Challenges

Although the number of contradictions into which politicians will enter when it comes to speaking is innumerable, this idea will not reflect those innumerable atrocities that they have said, say and will say. They are not collected in any media and luckily for them, nothing more than can be demonstrated through direct witnesses present in such circumstances, and who could apostille and attest to what we intend to demonstrate with this experiment.

## Whats Next?

It would be great if this project took shape, and one day it could have visibility, since it would be the only way for politicians first, and citizens later, to see the importance of not constantly lying, and that giving truth to any matter It is of vital importance for the benefit of citizens, not of politicians or whoever these beneficiaries want, which is often a change of perks.

## Thanks

* This course has been interesting and practical because it has included many exercises. I have to admit that, difficult, but it is what it is.
*Thank UNED and the University of Helsinki for facilitating this free course because I am unemployed and it helps me to open a new field.

  
-I have to clarify a small detail, that there are some words that do not have their corresponding tilde. I can't figure out how to do it, and why some words have it and others don't, even the same one, depending on the place, it has it or not. I've tried, but nothing. I will keep investigating.
