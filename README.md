# Title of the project

Final project of the course Building AI

## Summary

Politicians often lie when giving figures and data. With this tool we intend to compare one and the other with the real ones, as a lie detector. A small screen will be installed in front of the microphone that will turn red every time it is untrue.

## Background

With these instructions that we believe we are going to solve the veracity that the Spanish political class suffers from, in my case, since I am Spanish. There are innumerable cases that occur in which the inconsistencies in what they said a long time ago, and what they say now, are refuted. They do not follow guidelines and discipline when it comes to speaking, where they used to say “digo”, now they say “diego”. This is a very common Spanish expression that reflects that they change the speech according to their convenience. There are cases of real impudence when making statements or interviews, in which they literally deceive the population.

We will try to give veracity to:
• Interviews
• Statements
• Manifests
• Discussions
• Concentrations
• Assemblies


## How is it used?

A solution to this endemic problem, already rooted in the political class, not only in Spain, but internationally, is necessary. Lying for the sake of lying, especially some, carry it in their genes, and they do it so naturally that a large part of the population follows and applauds them. Their voices do not tremble when a political opponent rebuts them, because they follow their own, the lie. It is important that ordinary people know what kind of rulers they have, who they trust and who to entrust their votes to when going to the polls, because they will be the ones who will defend their interests.

## Data sources and AI methods
The data comes from the network, from the media, which are the ones that have all the files, both written and audio. Press, radio, television, RRSS, etc. They will be direct witnesses and judges of everything that comes out of their mouths and will immediately be the target of the magnifying glass when passing through their respective newspaper archives.

## Challenges

Although the number of contradictions into which politicians will enter when it comes to speaking is innumerable, this idea will not reflect those innumerable atrocities that they have said, say and will say. They are not collected in any media and luckily for them, nothing more than can be demonstrated through direct witnesses present in such circumstances, and who could apostille and attest to what we intend to demonstrate with this experiment.

## ¿Qué sigue?

Sería muy importante que este proyecto tuviera forma y algún día pudiera tener visibilidad ya que sería la única manera de que los políticos primero y la ciudadanía después vieran la importancia que tiene el no mentir constantemente y que el dar veracidad a cualquier asunto es de vital importancia para beneficio de los ciudadanos, no de los políticos o de a los que quieran estos beneficiarios, que muchas veces es un cambio de prebendas.

## Agradecimientos

* Este curso ha sido enormemente interesante y práctico porque ha incluido muchos ejercicios. He de reconocer que, difíciles, pero es lo que hay.
* Agradecer a la UNED y la Universidad de HelsinKi por facilitar este curso gratuíto porque estoy en paro y me sirve para poder abrir un campo nuevo.
  
  -He de aclarar un pequeño detalle, que hay algunas palabras que no llevan su tilde correspondiente. No consigo saber la forma de hacerlo, y por qué unas palabras la llevan y otras no, inclusive la misma, según el lugar, la tiene o no. Lo he intentado, pero nada. Seguiré indagando.
